## 🤖 AI Features Tutorial

### 1. Demand Forecasting

**Purpose**: Predict future inventory demand based on historical data

**How to Use**:
1. Navigate to "Demand Forecasting"
2. Select items or item categories
3. Choose forecast period (30, 60, 90 days)
4. Select forecasting model:
   - **Auto**: Let AI choose best model
   - **ARIMA**: For items with trends/seasonality
   - **Linear**: For stable demand patterns
   - **Prophet**: For complex seasonal patterns

**Interpreting Results**:
```
Forecast Results:
📊 Item: Laptop Dell XPS 15
📈 Predicted Demand (30 days): 24 units
📉 Confidence Interval: 18-30 units
🎯 Accuracy Score: 92%
⚠️ Alert: Higher than normal demand expected
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use at least 6 months of historical data
- Review forecast accuracy regularly
- Consider external factors (new projects, seasonal changes)

### 2. Inventory Optimization

**Purpose**: Calculate optimal stock levels to minimize costs while maintaining service levels

**How to Use**:
1. Go to "Inventory Optimization"
2. Select items to optimize
3. Set service level (default: 95%)
4. Choose optimization type:
   - **Individual**: Item-by-item optimization
   - **Batch**: Optimize multiple items together
   - **ABC-Weighted**: Focus on high-value items

**Understanding Results**:
```
Optimization Results:
📦 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): 50 units
🔄 Reorder Point: 35 units
🛡️ Safety Stock: 15 units
💰 Total Annual Cost: $12,450
📊 Service Level: 95%
```

**Key Metrics Explained**:
- **EOQ**: Optimal quantity to order each time
- **Reorder Point**: Stock level that triggers new order
- **Safety Stock**: Buffer stock for unexpected demand
- **Total Cost**: Sum of ordering, holding, and shortage costs

### 3. ABC Analysis

**Purpose**: Classify items by importance (Annual consumption value)

**Categories**:
- **A Items (80% of value)**: High priority, tight control
- **B Items (15% of value)**: Moderate priority, regular review
- **C Items (5% of value)**: Low priority, simple control

**How to Use**:
1. Select "ABC Analysis"
2. Choose classification criteria:
   - Annual consumption value (default)
   - Usage frequency
   - Criticality score
3. View results and apply different management strategies

**Action Guidelines**:
```
A Items: Daily monitoring, precise forecasting, supplier partnerships
B Items: Weekly reviews, standard procedures, moderate safety stock
C Items: Monthly checks, simple ordering rules, higher safety stock %
```

### 4. AI Recommendations

**Purpose**: Get actionable insights and suggested actions

**Types of Recommendations**:
- 🟢 **Order Now**: Items below reorder point
- 🟡 **Review Stock**: Items with unusual patterns
- 🔴 **Urgent**: Critical items at risk of stockout
- 💡 **Optimize**: Items with high cost reduction potential

**How to Use**:
1. Check "Recommendations" dashboard daily
2. Filter by priority, department, or category
3. Click "View Details" for specific actions
4. Mark recommendations as "Completed" when addressed

## 📋 Best Practices
