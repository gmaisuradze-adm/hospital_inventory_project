# AI Module In-Depth Analysis
## Hospital Inventory Management System

### ðŸŽ¯ CORE FUNCTIONALITY ANALYSIS

## 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Calculation
**Purpose**: Determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs.

**Formula**: EOQ = âˆš((2 Ã— Annual Demand Ã— Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost per Unit)

**Example**:
- Annual Demand: 1,000 units
- Ordering Cost: $150 per order
- Unit Cost: $100
- Holding Cost Rate: 25% of unit cost
- **Result**: EOQ = 77 units

**Business Impact**: Reduces inventory costs by 15-30% compared to arbitrary order quantities.

## 2. Reorder Point Optimization
**Purpose**: Determines when to place new orders to avoid stockouts.

**Formula**: ROP = (Average Daily Demand Ã— Lead Time) + Safety Stock

**Components**:
- Lead Time Demand: Expected usage during supplier delivery time
- Safety Stock: Buffer for demand variability
- Service Level: Probability of not stocking out (typically 95-99%)

**Example**:
- Daily Demand: 2.7 units/day
- Lead Time: 7 days
- Service Level: 95%
- **Result**: ROP = 25 units

## 3. ABC Analysis for Inventory Classification
**Purpose**: Categorizes inventory by value/importance for focused management.

**Categories**:
- **A Items** (80% of value, 20% of items): High-value, tight control
- **B Items** (15% of value, 30% of items): Moderate control
- **C Items** (5% of value, 50% of items): Loose control

**Business Rules**:
- A items: Weekly reviews, precise forecasting
- B items: Monthly reviews, standard forecasting  
- C items: Quarterly reviews, simple replenishment

## 4. Safety Stock Calculation
**Purpose**: Buffer inventory to handle demand uncertainty.

**Formula**: SS = Z-score Ã— âˆš(Lead Time) Ã— Standard Deviation of Demand

**Factors**:
- Service Level (95% = Z-score of 1.645)
- Demand Variability
- Lead Time Uncertainty

## 5. Demand Forecasting Methods
**Available Models**:
- **ARIMA**: For stable, trending data
- **Prophet**: For seasonal patterns
- **Random Forest**: For complex relationships
- **Fallback**: Moving average for simple cases

**Model Selection Logic**:
- < 30 data points â†’ ARIMA
- 30-100 points â†’ Random Forest
- > 100 points with seasonality â†’ Prophet
- Otherwise â†’ ARIMA

## 6. Multi-Objective Optimization
**Balances**:
- Cost minimization (60% weight)
- Service level maximization (40% weight)
- Constraint handling (budget, space, etc.)

## 7. Intelligent Recommendations Engine
**Generates**:
- Urgent reorder alerts
- Category-specific strategies
- Supplier negotiation suggestions
- Seasonal adjustment recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategies
